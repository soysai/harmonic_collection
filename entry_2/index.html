                  If you live in a multicultural environment...you can simply <em>make friends!</em>
                  Wait.. I know what you are thinking..
                <em>"What if they think I am weird?"</em>
                Trust me, it is quite the opposite. In fact, many appreciate it!
                They <em>appreciate</em> the time and effort that it took to learn their language,
                appreciate you reaching to them!<br></p>

                <p><strong>
                Ofc, don't be creepy about it, or approach them just because you are absolutely itching to speak to <em>anyone</em>
                who speaks that language and not that <em>someone.</em>
                That, my friend, is devaluing that person.
                Yeah, don't do that, please.</strong><br></p>

               <p> And if you live in a relatively homogenous place, there's still a buch of things you can do to learn!
                  For instance, you can attend global fairs or cultural events. (In Bangalore, where I am from, there is an annual Japanese Hubba).
                  Or, you could watch movies or TV shows (Youtube clips keep me engaged and listening to a lot of them allows me to slowly compute words >:])
                  Or... you could go online, look up audiobooks or watch "Useful Japanese words!" 
                I could go on and on and on, but you get the gist, there are unlimite possibilities in today's age ofe globalization...
